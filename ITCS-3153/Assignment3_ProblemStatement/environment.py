Define basic classes for Agents and Environments, including for visualization purposes. 

The class hierarchies are as follows:

Thing ## A physical object that can exist in an environment
    Agent
    Obstacle
    Dirt
    Wall
    ...

Environment ## An environment holds objects, runs simulations
    XYEnvironment
    GraphicEnvironment
