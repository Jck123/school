# School stuff

If you're here, you're most likely a recruiter, college professor, or TA grading work.
All of this work is stuff I've done in my years both at Wake Technical Community College and University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Let it be known that some of the work here may have profanity in it, as I wasn't really expecting to make this public when I was working on those projects.
That being said, I would rather not censor it as it's still my history, just know I understand professionalism and would not put profanities in any company's code.

With that, enjoy my school repository.
