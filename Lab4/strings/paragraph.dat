Most people believe that mental health conditions are rare and "happen to someone else". In fact,
mental health conditions are common and widespread. An estimated 44 million Americans suffer from 
some form of mental disorder in a given year. Most families are not prepared to cope with learning 
their loved one has a mental illness. It can be physically and emotionally trying, and can make us
feel vulnerable to the opinions and judgments of others. If you think you or someone you know may have
a mental or emotional problem, it is important to remember there is hope and help.
